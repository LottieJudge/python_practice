Data Notes: 

The way in which we use data is only successful if the data we're using is good. E.G in medical fields when studies and cases are mostly modelled on white men, it leaves a lot of room for the rest of the population. 

Statistics: 

Statistics help us test the likelihood of an event happening by random choice vs systematically. 

E.G with discrimnatory hiring you would look at all candidates across a year and see if it was statistically possible to get to the hiring rates they had. Had 50% of candidates been women? and they had only employed 3% women - that's systematic not random chance.
