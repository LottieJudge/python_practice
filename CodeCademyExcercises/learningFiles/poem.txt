William Blake is a mug pass it on 


This green and pleasant land that is often wet and dreary, grey and mardy, made for the hardy
A land that should belong to knotted trees, lichens and our communities 
A land owned by the gentry, a carefully chosen few because their grandads, grandad was given that land with the singular intention of taking it from you 
a tradition that started with the Roman or the Viking, 
continuing with lords and dukes cutting up Scotland for hunting and moving Welsh towns for mining 
They pen it all in removing your right to roam, making and taking more room for sheep that destroy the tiny oaks before theyâ€™ve a chance to take hold 
Fuck your pastures, fuck your bow of burning gold
no palm oil and no avocado, save the Amazon but did you know 
this green and pleasant land should be a green, brown and twisted land 
full to the edges of trees, a rainforest of our own as far as the eye can see and the feet can go 
No more pleasant pastures seen, let the rainforest flow x
