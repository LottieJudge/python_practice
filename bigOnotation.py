bigOis = 'Big O Notation refers to the time and space complexity of an algorithm/function compared to the input. The more time and space a function takes. E.g Nested For Loops etc, the worse it is'

O1 = 'Constant: regardless of the size of the input the execution time/space remains the same. This is the most efficient, in an ideal world all functions would be 0(1) baby'
