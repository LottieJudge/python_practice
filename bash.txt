Customisation with Bash:
A bash profile is a file used to store your environment settings.

On most computers it's in the home directory under .bash_profile

when you start a session the bash profile will load before executing commmands

-the . indicates a hidden file
- the bash_profile name is also important as it's how the command line recognises what it is
