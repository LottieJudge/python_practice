# Critical Thinking notes: 

In logic arguments != rows. Arguments, like the data given to a function, are simply reasons to believe a logical conclusion. e.g 

1) It is raining.
2) If you choose not to take an umbrella, you will get wet.. 
..  You should take a brolly 

Points 1 - 2 are premises of the argument and final sentence is the conclusion. 
 
## Sentences: 
In logic we are only interested in sentences that can act as a premise or conclusion of an argument. So a sentence in logic should be a boolean, it should be either True or False. Fact vs Opinion. Opinion based sentences and questions are not useful sentences to logic, even if they are to conversation. 

This is the same with imperatives as commands. e.g "Sit up!" is neither true or false and therefor not a sentence in logic. If the remark being made can not be distilled down into a boolean, it is not a logical sentence.
