the > command in terminal/version redirects the standard 

echo 'Hello World!' > hello.txt
cat hello.txt
// Prints Hello World! to the terminal 

you can use > redirect to move the contents of one file to another e.g 
$ cat oceans.txt > continents.txt
// would move anthing in oceans.txt to continents.txt overwriting the original text 

To add to a file without losing the original contents we use the redirect >>
$ cat oceans.txt >> continents.txt
// will add oceans to continents, not overide it 

< takes the standard input from the file and inputs it into the command 

cat < lakes.txt == cat lakes.txt 

| is a pipe - this is command to command redirection. 

Sort takes the standard input and orders it alphabetical as the standard output 

$ sort list.txt
// output is alphabetical

save the alphabetized one as a new file 
$ cat list.txt | sort > sorted_list.txt
// saves the list to a new file
