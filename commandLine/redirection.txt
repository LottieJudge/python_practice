the > command in terminal/version redirects the standard 

echo 'Hello World!' > hello.txt
cat hello.txt
// Prints Hello World! to the terminal 

you can use > redirect to move the contents of one file to another e.g 
$ cat oceans.txt > continents.txt
// would move anthing in oceans.txt to continents.txt overwriting the original text 

To add to a file without losing the original contents we use the redirect >>
$ cat oceans.txt >> continents.txt
// will add oceans to continents, not overide it 

< takes the standard input from the file and inputs it into the command 

cat < lakes.txt == cat lakes.txt 

| is a pipe - this is command to command redirection. 

Sort takes the standard input and orders it alphabetical as the standard output 

$ sort list.txt
// output is alphabetical

save the alphabetized one as a new file 
$ cat list.txt | sort > sorted_list.txt
// saves the list to a new file 

Uniq - stands for unique and filters out adjacent, duplicate lines in a file. 
to filter out non adjacent duplicate lines you would need to use sort, pipe and then uniq. 

e.g 

$ sort list.txt | uniq  

grep stands for 'Global Regular Expression Print' - it'll search for lines in files that match the given expression - it's case sensitive. 

grep -i = this enables grep to be case insensitive. 

$ grep -i Your Mum

grep -R will search through all files in a directory and give you it back as a list 
grep -Rl (lowercase) will give you just the file names, no list. 

$ grep -R 
./commandLine/list.txt:Trek Bike 
./commandLine/sorted_list.txt:Trek Bike 

VS 

$ grep -Rl Trek 
//./commandLine/list.txt
./commandLine/sorted_list.txt

sed stands for Stream Editor. it accepts an input and will then modify the file based on the expression given. Like find and replace 

$ sed 's/Trek/Chopper' sorted_list.txt
// s stands for substitution 
Trek - the text to find 
Chopper - the text to replace it with 
this will only replace the first instance to replace all you would use 

$ sed 's/Trek/Chopper/g' sorted_list.txt
// the g stands for global and is a global change 

and these will only work in the terminal to replace it in the actual file you would use 

$ sed -i 's/Trek/Chopper/g' sorted_list.txt
