#tuples are immutable meaning they can't be changed but they are more energy efficient in both time and memory (and money baby) - good to use if working with data that doesn't ever need to be changed. A tuple is defined by a variable and then normal brackets (). Tuples can also hold just one item as long as it's followed by a comma 

popcorn_flavours = ("Sweet", "Salty", "Cinnamon", "Butter")

#indexing works the same as lists 
print(popcorn_flavours[0])
