Critical Thinking notes: 

In logic arguments != rows. Arguments, like the data given to a function, are simply reasons to believe a logical conclusion. e.g 

1) It is raining.
2) If you choose not to take an umbrella, you will get wet.. 
..  You should take a brolly 

Points 1 - 2 are premises of the argument and final sentence is the conclusion. 

Sentences: 
In logic we are only interested in sentences that can act as a premise or conclusion of an argument. So a sentence in logic should be a boolean, it should be either True or False. Fact vs Opinion. Opinion based sentences and questions are not useful sentences to logic, even if they are to conversation.
