#Loops are used for repeating tasks in code. E.G looping through a playlist on spotify, or given a specific pin and email looping through customer database to find the matches and returning that info 

playlist = ["English Rose", "Drop Seven", "Worms"]
for song in playlist:
  print(f"now playing {song}")
